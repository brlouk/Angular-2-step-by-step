# Angular-2-step-by-step
This Tutorial is designed for software developers who want to learn the basics of Angular 2 in simple and easy steps.

Unlike Angular 1, we need a boilerplate to start working with Angular 2, TypeScript and dependencies. That's we will do in step1.

Each Step has its own folder so you can work on each step separately. You can take a look also at the code source for more details.

# Steps

### Step 1 : Scaffolding / Boilerplate

At this time, it's very hard to find the best boilerplate for production.

Angular Team recommend AngularCLI (https://cli.angular.io/) but it's still in incubation phase and we don't have a full control on building phase.

The best alternative for me, It's to use FountainJS (http://fountainjs.io/) which I've already used for production to build a ReactJS based application.

#### Get started
* install https://nodejs.org
* npm install -g yo generator-fountain-webapp
* yo fountain-webapp
* Answers : Angular2 -> Webpack with NPM -> TypeScript -> SAAS -> Jenkins -> Just a hello world -> @angular/router

Now, you can start the server : npm run serve , http://localhost:3000
